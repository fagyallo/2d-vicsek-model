## 2 dimensional Vicsek-model Jupyter Notebook with boundary conditions
\\The self propelled particles' movement is modelled in a unitary square
The initial parameters are:\\
+ $N$: the number of particles
+ $v_0$: magnitude of the initial velocity (according to uniform distribution):
+ $\eta$: noise-parameter
+ $R$: interaction range
+ d$t$: size of a timestep
+ Number of iterations\\
The output is a movie (.mp4) that shows their movement during the simulation, according to the initial parameters.
